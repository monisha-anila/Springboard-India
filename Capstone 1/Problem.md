# Gapminder health analysis 

## Problem Statement 
- What opportunities exist for <b>WHO health experts</b> to reduce `cancer patients to 0%` by the end of 2012 to spend WHO `annual budget of 25% `through <b>increasing organ surgery or starting radiotherapy trials<b>?  
- A brief documented [Problem Statement](https://github.com/monisha-anila/Springboard-India/blob/master/Capstone%201/Capstone%20Problem%20Statement%20%5BMonisha%20Anila%5D.pdf)

## Context
- World Health Organization(WHO) spends `$40B for Cancer` and `$90B for AIDS` treatment to sustain <b>humanity</b>. 
- `Cancer` count <b>increasing tremendously</b> all over the world while `AIDS` starting to increase all over the world through <b>blood transfusion</b>.

## Success critiera 
- Implementing an `effective budget strategy` to `reduce cancer` patient to 0% by the end of <b>2012</b>.


## Scope of solution 
- Identify `cancer types that correlate` the `life expectancy`
- Formation of `linear equation` for <b>life expectancy</b> can be used for other cancer types?
- Statistics- [`Excel`](https://github.com/monisha-anila/Springboard-India/blob/master/Capstone%201/Gap%20minder%20health.xlsx), [`Tableau`](https://public.tableau.com/profile/monisha.anila#!/vizhome/Capstone1save/Dashboard1) and [`PowerPoint`](https://github.com/monisha-anila/Springboard-India/blob/master/Capstone%201/Capstone%20one%20Statistics%20Slides%20%5BMonisha%20Anila%5D.pdf)


## Constraints in solution 
- Expertise to `handle missing data` and <b>feature modelling</b> in `time series` and `genomics`.


## Stake holders
1. <b>Ministry of Health </b>
2. <b>Government agencies</b>


## Data Source 
1. [Gapminder data](https://github.com/monisha-anila/Springboard-India/blob/master/Capstone%201/Gap%20minder%20health.xlsx)
- Note: Use `Log data tab as primary data source` and check others tabs to `find EDA and Insights`. 

## Issue Tree

1. `Cancer awareness`
2. `Cancer Unawareness`
3. `Future work`

### Awesome tips
- Use of `Log` transformation for data makes it easier to use `predictive modeling` .
- <i>Make sure to check final page of presentation as Life expectancy is their but no deaths which answers constant population growth.</i>
